At Fireleaf, protecting the build, process, and intellectual property is just as important as creative output.

🔐 Security by Design:

✅ API keys stored securely on the server (never client-side).

✅ All .env and sensitive files are gitignored and excluded from public repos.

✅ Serverless proxy endpoints prevent direct key exposure.

✅ CORS policies are in place to manage cross-origin access securely.

✅ Continuous hardening of access points to protect the integrity of the Fireleaf ecosystem.

Best Practices:

Never commit API keys to version control.

Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials.

Rotate API keys regularly.

Monitor API activity for anomalies.

Protect build assets and code signatures that reflect proprietary systems developed under Art By Tovias.

🛡️ All original build scripts, configurations, creative assets, and architecture under Fireleaf & Art By Tovias are protected intellectual property. Unauthorized duplication or redistribution is prohibited.

🌱 Vision & Future Work

This is only the seed. Fireleaf’s AI Book Generator will grow into a fully featured creative suite — blending storytelling, design, and automation. Future expansions may include:

🧠 Smarter session memory & draft history

✨ Advanced formatting and story structuring tools

🛠️ Real-time editing with voice-to-text prompts

🌍 Multi-language support for global creators

📚 Export-ready manuscript formatting for publishing

This isn’t just about writing books.
It’s about equipping creators with tools that protect their process while magnifying their voice.
